Celery is a simple, flexible and reliable distributed system to process vast amounts of messages, while providing operations with the tools required to maintain such a system.  

It’s a task queue with focus on real-time processing, while also supporting task scheduling.

Celery has a large and diverse community of users and contributors, you should come join us [on IRC](http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/getting-started/resources.html#irc-channel) or [our mailing-list](http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/getting-started/resources.html#mailing-list).
