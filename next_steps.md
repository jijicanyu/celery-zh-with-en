# Next Steps

The [First Steps with Celery](http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/getting-started/first-steps-with-celery.html#first-steps) guide is intentionally minimal. In this guide I will demonstrate what Celery offers in more detail, including how to add Celery support for your application and library.

This document does not document all of Celery’s features and best practices, so it’s recommended that you also read the [User Guide](http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/index.html#guide)

* Calling Tasks  
* Canvas: Designing Workflows  
* Routing  
* Remote Control
